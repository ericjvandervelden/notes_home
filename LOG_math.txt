Yes, if $n$ is a rational integer, then $\mathbb{Z}[i]/n\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a field if and only if it is an integral domain, if and only if $n$ is a prime number which is $\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$.  You can argue this using some elementary number theory and some results about unique factorization domains (as well as the fact that $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unique factorization domain).  I'll show that if $n$ is *not* a prime number which is $3 \pmod{4}$, then that ring is not an integral domain.
